### Cruddy App Todo

#### Basic Improvments (requirements)

- [ ] create indivdiual items
- [ ] delete individual items
- [ ] edit individual items
* Basic requirements planning:
  * add feature to create multiple notes; create title and note input fields ~ 3 hour
  * add feature to delete multiple notes ~ 3 hours
  * add feature to edit note; edit individual note at a time only ~ 5 hours


##### Notes
- [ ] Keep DOM and localStorage matching 
- [ ] Remember event Delegation when adding new items to .show-text
- [ ] make sure we do not duplicate data
- [ ] add different values to the item

  ex.
```javascript
 item =  {
  id: "thing used for key",
  text-value: "some text",
  categories: [ 'cat1', 'cat2' ],
  isComplete: boolean,
  dateCreated: dateCreated,
  dateCompleted: dateCompleted
  ...
  etc
  }
```

#### Potential Libraries
- [ ] lodash/underscore
- [ ] jquery ui
- [ ] bootstrap/material (css library)

#### My Spin
- [ ] timestamp for date created and due date
- [ ] sort by due date

* My spins planning:
* add timestamps for date created and due date using datepicker plug-in ~ 2 hour
* sort notes by due date by clicking "due date" column header ~ 5 hours
